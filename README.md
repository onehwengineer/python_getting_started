Step-by-step tutorial on getting started with Python in MacOS Big Sur

## Summary
Python3 --> comes with MacOS Big Sur
HomeBrew (which also installs Xcode Command Line Tools)
  |_ pip3
  |_


- [0] Check if **Python3** is already installed
  - In Terminal, `python3 —version`
  - If Python3 is installed, it will show the version. If not, an error.

- [1] Install **Xcode** (along with **Command Line Tools** and **Git**)
  - Check if Xcode is already installed. In Terminal, `- xcode-select -p`
    - If directory exists, Xcode is installed   
    - If not, install Xcode from App Store
  - Check if Git installed : `git --version`
  - **Xcode Command Line Tools** will be installed in step [2]

- [2] Install **Homebrew** (& **Command Line Tools**)
  - Homebrew is a package manager that let's you install stuff that Apple or Linux didn't need
  - Homebrew is made with Ruby, so it will be modifying your computer’s Ruby path. 
  - Open Terminal, and paste :
  - ```/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"```
    - The curl command pulls a script from the specified URL. 
    - This script will explain what it will do and then pauses the process to prompt you to confirm. This provides you with a lot of feedback on what the script is going to be doing to your system and gives you the opportunity to verify the process.  
  - Confirm Homebrew installation, `brew doctor`
  - This will also install **Xcode Command Line Tools** (this step takes a while... 2.5GB)
    - Confirm installation by `xcode-select -p` -> Directory will show up (.../CommandLineTools)

- [3] Install **Python3**
  - ```brew install python```
  - Along with Python 3, Homebrew will install **pip3**, **setuptools**, and **wheel**
    - (TO UPGRADE : `brew upgrade` + `brew upgrade python3`)
  - Place Homebrew directory at the top of the PATH environment variable
  - This will ensure that Homebrew installations will be called over the tools that Mac OS X may select automatically that could run counter to the development environment we’re creating.
  - You should create or open the ~/.bash_profile file with the command-line text editor nano using the nano command:
    - `vi ~/.bash_profile`
  - Once the file opens up in the Terminal window, write the following:
    - `export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH`
  - For these changes to activate, in the Terminal window, type:
    - `source ~/.bash_profile`




- [a] VSCode
  - Install `Python extension for Visual Studio Code`
  - Select Python Interpreter -> `Python 3.8.2 64-bit, /usr/bin/python3`
  - Install packages by :
    - `pip3 install --user package-name` ("--user" is important here!)
